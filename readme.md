# Hopenhayn Model Solver

This is intended to follow [Chris Edmond's Lecture Notes](http://www.chrisedmond.net/phd2019/econ90003_lecture19.pdf).

Status is as follows:

- Distributions, policy and value functions look qualitatively right
- Quantitatively I suspect my parameter values might be slightly off so results dont perfectly replicate Chris Edmond's notes
