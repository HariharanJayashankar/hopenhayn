# Hopenhayn Model Solver

This is intended to follow [Chris Edmond's Lecture Notes]("http://www.chrisedmond.net/phd2019/econ90003_lecture19.pdf").

Status as of now: wrote down the structure for everything but results looks weird. Particularly
	- Value function somewhat has the right shape but not the same scale and not the same "turning point" as Chris' notes
	- Distribution $\mu$ looks way off
